In our website we took a few assumptions:
1. The website should be opened in fullscreen mode for the best functionality. The site may need to be zoomed out on laptops with smaller screen sizes(for example: on mac 16" it works on 100% but on mac 13" you might need to zoom out to 80% for full functionality).
2. Buttons have been added in songs pages but they are not functional.
3. Some images have been taken from the internet and some have been added in the repository as they were not available on the internet or were edited for decoration purposes.
4. We took the top songs of the albums of the different artists instead of taking all the songs.
5. You can hover over the songs but they are not clickable as specified in the pdf.
6. On minimising the about page the text overlaps.
